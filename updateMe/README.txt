This website is capable of updating itself to the values placed in the updateMe files.
For it to achieve the proper result, it's crucial that the text is imputted properly

Grammar:
}H      <content> representes a header with the name <content>, having n amount of heading elements after it
~He     <content> represents a heading element with the name <content> tied to the heading it is under 

There can be multiple header elements under a single header. The documentation will detail which ones are capable of doing that
The amount of spaces between the tags (}H, ~He) and the actual content (email, seds@unlv.edu) does not matter; I tab for readability 

Example:
}H      email
~He     seds@unlv.edu

Example:
}H      upcoming_launch_dates
~He     December 21, 2019
~He     January 21, 2020
~He     February 22, 2020
